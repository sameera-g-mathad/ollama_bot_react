![Logo]('readme_images/logo.png')

This is a simple chat application that allows users to interact with an AI model using Ollama. The application is built with React and TypeScript using Next.js, and it includes features like chat history, message submission, and theme switching.

## Next Steps

Create a extension for the Ollama Bot that allows users to interact with the AI model in web applications. The extension should be able to send messages to the AI model and receive responses, allowing users to have conversations with the AI model in real-time.
